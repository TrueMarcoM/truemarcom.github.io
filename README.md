# Hello, this is part of an assignment for a course I'm taking. Please visit other repo such as GroupProject2.



# Initial Findings
### Elements
I notice numerous elements such as 
- head
- meta
- link
- title
- script
- body
- h1
- p
Most of the content on the site is just text being displayed on the screen. 
### Attributes
I notice numerous attributes such as 
- rel
- src
- href
- name
- charset
- lang

# My Work
I made a simple form page with 2 input fields using the input elements. The attributes are of type "text", meaning that is what the input will be.
Both input elements have their unique id names so they can be accessed later on using JavaScript.

The input element at the end of type "button" is what allows the form to be submitted.

The label element allows me to organize my input fields.
The br element is used for line breaking, as I wanted to make some gaps, so not everything is so close together.

The body element is used to store the main content of the page, which would take up the majority of the screen.

The title element helps me identify the website name that I chose.
